# Image-Genre-Classification

My objective for this project is to produce image classifiers which are able to determine the genre associated with the images which have come from film and T.V shows. For the purpose of this report, I have decided to use three genres, these are, Romance, Action and Anime. I feel these are distinctly different genres with different themes associated with the images from these genres. I hope to see whether these models are able to pick up on the patterns which are displayed within the genres from the images provided.

Please read the report to have complete understanding of the project

The notebooks for the VGG16 and AlexNet model are also provided.
